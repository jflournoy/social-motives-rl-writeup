than a community sample of their peers. The data
from this study provides new insights into why these
behavioral problems arise. First, the participants
who had been exposed to early adversity were less
able than their peers to correctly learn which stimuli
were likely to result in reward, even after repeated
feedback. This difficulty discerning and using information from the environment explained the higher
levels of behavioral problems in participants exposed
to early adversity, and was maintained even after
statistically controlling for adolescents’ general
cognitive abilities.",NA,NA,
