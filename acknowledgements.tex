To analogize in a loose and bizarre fashion, one might liken the contribution to the totality of human knowledge of a dissertation such as this one to the contribution of the mass of a single tardigrade to that of the planet Jupiter.
One also might liken the expendature of effort among a vast coordinated social network necessary to accomplish both feats.
Over the next few paragraphs, I will attempt to laud those who are share, really, the lions share of the responsibility for what is culminated in these pages.

Let's start at the beginning: 
My mom, who tried to convince me before I was ready that the equality 2x = 4 was an interesting construction, who decided in her late 30s, with two kids, to earn a BA in finance, and who then became the first person in her family to get a graduate degree (in counseling).
My dad, whose sense of justice and service is a constant touch stone as I and others navigate a renaissance in scientific practice.
