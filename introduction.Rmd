Adolescence, the period of development between childhood and adulthood, is a time of both vigorous health and increased health risk.
An extensive body of literature describes trajectories in the rates of health-risking behaviors like binge drinking [@chassin2009;@patrick2011], and risky sexual behavior [@stevenson2007] that, along with rates of unintentional injury, peak during late adolescence and early adulthood [@centersfordiseasecontrolandprevention2003;@willoughby2013].
A major focus of the field of adolescent developmental psychology and neuroscience is to describe what gives rise to this phenomenon.
A variety of theories current in this field may capture many features of adolescent cognition and behavior that have relevance for health-related decisions, but most do not focus on how such cognition and behavior may serve adaptive functions.
Here, adaptivity is concptualized in the evolutionary sense, where reproductive fitness over the course of evolutionary history is the criterion.
Taking a more explicitly functional approach will help to strengthen and unify our understanding of behavior during this transition into adulthood.

One early attempt to explain adolescent decision making proposes that youth make decisions based on imperfect information, or exaggerated expectations of invincibility [@elkind1967].
However, on most questions, adolescents show no particular bias toward over or underestimating probabilities, though their estimation is not perfect; the probabilities they estimate also generally correlate with prospective outcomes [@debruin2007;@fischhoff2000;@fischhoff2008].
Adolescents do, however, overestimate their probability of dying [@fischhoff2010], which may be functionally important if it enhances the value of immediate rewards, especially if those rewards are relevant for thriving and reproductive fitness in short-term time frames.

Some more recent approaches use evidence from neuroscience to describe an imbalance between action-promoting, and action-inhibiting processes that is thought to be a cause of risk-taking behavior.
Two distinct theories are variations on this idea.
The dual systems model suggests that during adolescence, the system that encodes socially and emotionally rewarding stimuli increases its sway on behavior more rapidly than cognitive control does [@shulman2016].
The imbalance model proposes that the miscalibration is not just between two systems, but rather that an optimal balance between multiple systems is still developing [@casey_beyond_2016], and that this global imbalance leads to risky behavior.
No approach in this vein deals directly with why certain behaviors are more likely to be selected by the psychological processes or neural systems that hold an excess of power during adolescence.

Two other theories do address certain functional aspects of adolescent decision making.
Social reorientation theory suggests that during adolescence, individuals shift their dominant social network from the family to peers [@nelson2016].
This shift is in part driven by developmentally appropriate changes in the salience of interactions with peers and potential romantic partners, which helps motivate adolescents to enter adulthood.
Health-risking behavior increases are seen, in part, as a by-product of differences between what the family/caregiver network values and what the new peer group values, though the reasons for these value differences are not fully explicated.

Fuzzy trace theory also has relevance for explaining the function of possible decreased sensitivity to uncertainty (i.e., risk) during adolescence.
This theoretical framework posits that adolescents have yet to develop heuristics that tend to govern more experienced, adult decision making, and so are more willing to explore the full problem space [perhaps, in part, to develop these adult heuristics; @romer2017].
If some possible outcomes of this exploration are negative health-consequences, then this exploration obviously constitutes health-risking behavior.
The fuzzy trace perspective, and related views, hold that this exploration is an essential developmental task in adolescence, allowing adolescents to build expertise and wisdom about the world they must engage with as adults [@blakemore2014;@crone2012;@romer2017].

A model of decision-making borrowed from economics can help integrate functional perspectives, and does not require problematic neurodevelopment to explain adolescent-specific changes in risk behavior.
One of the biggest challenges for imbalance models (but not the two, more functional approaches) is that adolescent health risking behavior may involve either impulsive _or_ highly cognitively controlled behaviors.
The value-based choice view goes beyond the ideas of competing systems, describing decision-making as the integration of expected-value inputs from myriad sources that culminates in the selection of behaviors with large expected values [@pfeifer2018].
The expected-value inputs may come from basic appetitive processes like desire for food or sex, as well as from self concept, social norms, peer expectations, emotional states, and theoretically any other sources that have influence over decision-making.
From the vantage point of this perspective, it becomes clear that adolescent refinement of motivations for fitness-relevant behaviors related to status and mate-seeking could have a significant impact on value computations.
In other words, if the function of adolescence is to complete the development of the organism to the fully adult form, motivations related to adult social concerns like status and mate-seeking are likely to have increasing weight as inputs to a value-based choice process.

In order to understand health-risking behavior, and decision making during adolescence more generally, it is important to begin to try to understand the motivational inputs that are related to evolutionarily relevant developmental tasks.
As is described by fuzzy trace theory, adolescents do not yet have decision-making heuristics in place regarding their behavior in these motivational domains, and so they must explore, often using a decision-making approach that makes more fine-grained use of outcome probabilities [@romer2017].
Differences in various motivations will increase or decrease the expected value of both exploration and exploitation behaviors.
A substantial body of research documents broad motivational changes in adolescence as captured by the sensation-seeking construct [@harden2011;@steinberg2008;@ruch2001;@zuckerman1978], but very little work examines adolescent motivation at a finer resolution.
Since learning is the process by which decision-making is influenced by previous experience gained during exploration, examining learning processes directly may be able to provide a window into effects of motivations on decision-making during adolescence.

# Motivations from an Evolutionary Psychology Perspective

The impact of evolutionarily relevant motivations should be considered especially carefully because selection pressure is likely to be a powerful force shaping biological predispositions, and individual differences, during this phase of development [@baltes1997;@mottus2018].
Relative to other primates, human childhood is extremely protracted, essentially representing a 'pause' in development, with coincident more-rapid post-pubertal development [@delgiudice2009].
From a birds-eye-view, this places the psychology and behavior of the adolescent phase at a transition point between a relatively quiescent period, and period of acceleration into an adult motivational frame. 
Particularly striking changes during this period of development include increasing propensity for adult-like behaviors, such as the inception of  sexual and romantic behavior [@cavazos-rehg2009;@harden2014a], and navigation of shifting social networks and status hierarchies [@cairns1995;@steinberg2001] with possible consequences for adult success [@shi2017].
As adolescents develop more adult-like motivations for mate-seeking and status, they also begin to gain access to adult-like means for enacting those motivations, many of which come with health-relevant risks.

To some extent, the impact on adolescent behavior of motivations for status and mates has been either acknowledged or studied.
With regard to sex, authors often acknowledge that the transition to sexual maturity is a defining biological feature of adolescence,.
However, little contemporary adolescent research investigates directly the increased motivation to explore and engage in romantic and sexual behavior [@suleiman2017], though this may be in part due to the political sensitivity of this topic [@harden2014a].
Status is studied more directly, with many articles focusing on the antecedents of popularity [@lafontana2002;@LiChineseAmericanchildren2012;@OwensTheymightnot2009;@rose2004], as well as on possible consequences [@allen2005;@cillessen2014;@meuwese_friends_2017].
Even so, though there is a long history of research on motivation in psychology, very little contemporary adolescent research situates mate-seeking and status in a broader motivational framework.

The fundamental social motives (FSM) framework proposed by @kenrick2010 may be helpful for understanding differential effects of both domains, as it parses motives into a small set based on adaptive problems humans are likely to face.
These domains might be said to be fundamental in the sense that they are, plausibly, evolved psychological inputs on value computations during decision making processes that have relevance for survival and reproduction.
The evolutionary-psychological framework is especially important for understanding adolescence, a developmental period that may be considerably sensitive to selection pressure [@baltes1997;@ellis2012;@suleiman2016].
Using the FSM framework allows integration of findings from this work into the broader evolutionary psychology conversation that is beginning to arise in adolescent research.

Another advantage of the FSM approach is that it parses motivations by the functional importance of the motivation with regard to likely adaptive problems.
There are many traditions [@wiggins1991] that would place status motives and mate-seeking motives within one of two broad domains, respectively, such as agency and communion [@bakan1966], power and intimacy [@mcadams_power_1985].
However, those traditions are not able to capture the distinct challenges inherent in various social relations, which map onto important relationships at different developmental stages (specifically, mate-seeking as a result of puberty; also, for example, kin care in later adulthood).
The fact that the FSM approach organizes the measurement of motivation around broad relationship categories, may make it especially useful for thinking about adolescence, which is proposed to be marked by a restructuring of an adolescent's place in the social world [@nelson2005;@nelson2016].

Literature on risk-taking behavior directly implicates both mate-seeking and status motivation domains in risky sexual behaviors and a variety of potentially status-related health-risking behaviors such as substance use.
For example, in a study which assessed perceptions of the sexual-self among adolescents, there was an association between increasing sexually-motivated self-perceptions and various forms of sexual risk-taking [@buzwell1996].
With regard to status, there is some evidence consistent with the idea that adolescents who have high popularity as rated by peers may try to maintain their status through health-risking behaviors [@mayeux2008].
Beyond health-risking behaviors, these motives may also be crucial ingredients in understanding a whole class of risk-taking that is more positively valued, including but not limited to risks taken in service of extending one's social and physical environment beyond one's childhood home [@sercombe2014].
It is unfortunate that although the above literature acknowledges motivation, and measures related constructs, mate-seeking and status _motives_ are rarely a direct target of measurement.
There is a need for research investigating how adolescent learning and decision-making is shaped in the presence of stimuli which are motivationally relevant to their developmental stage.

## Status motive

Status during adolescence has been studied from a variety of perspectives, including perceptions, structure, strategies, and outcomes [@allen2005;@jarvinen_adolescents_1996;@lafontana2010;@savin-williams1979;@SelfhoutEmergingLateAdolescent2010;@underwood1996].
Although the motivation to gain status (as distinct from social status, per se) has been addressed, the literature on status-related social goals typically relies on self-report.
For example, using self-report measures, @lafontana2010 found that prioritizing status over other domains (e.g., achievement, friendship) peaks in late adolescence.
This kind of work often also employs peer-nomination of popularity or sociometric methods, and has generally found that self-reported motivation to pursue popularity, or related agentic or dominance goals, is only weakly associated with social status from middle childhood [@rodkin2013] through adolescence [@caravita2012;@cillessen2014;@jarvinen_adolescents_1996;@ojanen2005].
This highlights the important distinction between an intrinsic motivation to learn about and navigate status hierarchies, and the ability (or lack thereof) to successfully actualize that motive.
This same literature also implicates both popularity per se, _as well as_ status-related social goals, in negative behaviors like agression [@cillessen2014;@ojanen2005] and bullying [@caravita2012], indicating that it is crucial to study motives to fully understand processes and outcomes related to status in adolescence.
However, reliance on self-report is not always optimal, especially in a domain with strong social norms about the value of having and attaining high status may plausibly contaminate these measures.
It would be useful to be able to make use of a behavioral measure of status motives that is less susceptible to self-report biases.


## Mate-seeking motive

Puberty marks the beginning of sexual maturation of an individual, and the beginning of the adolescent developmental period [@susman_puberty_2009].
Though there has been extensive research on the importance of romantic and sexual relationships during adolescence, peer and parent influences, risky patterns of sexual behavior, and health-relevant outcomes [@capaldi_heterosexual_2002;@schalet2011;@suleiman2015], there has been very little research on sexual development as it relates to motivation.
Indeed, while the study of risky sexual behavior is clearly important, there is so little research on the normative aspects of sexual development during adolescence (for example as a developmentally appropriate motivation) that a recent review called it "the 'elephant in the room' of adolescent ... development" [@suleiman2017].
Most work to date has focused on risk factors for unsafe sex unrelated to motivation [e.g., poverty, peer influence, parental monitoring; @carlson2014;@james2012;@santelli1992].
This neglects the importance of sexual motivation (i.e., desire) in the development of an empowered and responsible sexual identity, impeding efforts to reduce health-risks through sexual education [@fine2006].
Although sexual desire is recognized rhetorically as an important component in emerging adolescent romantic and sexual behavior, its direct interrogation through either behavioral or self report measures is limited.
Likewise, the role of mate-seeking motives in the exploratory behavior characteristic of adolescence is also under-studied.
As with status, reliance on self-report may not be optimal, especially given the extremely sensitive nature of this topic both socially and politically.

# Reinforcement learning

As noted above, research on status and mate-seeking motives during adolescence is either largely absent, or reliant on self-report.
The field would benefit greatly from a new measure that provides an alternative method to capture individual and developmental differences in the salience of these motives across the transition from childhood through adolescence and into adulthood.
A primary focus of this work is therefore the design and validation of a new behavioral measure to do so.
The measure, described below, uses a standard reinforcement learning paradigm and experimentally manipulates the extent to which learning targets are relevant to different motivational domains.
The basic reinforcement learning paradigm has been well described in both humans and rodents [@collins2012;@glimcher2009;@jones2011].
The salience of stimuli in such a paradigm directly impacts learning [@grossberg1975;@mackintosh1975;@cunningham2012].
The premise of this new measure is that linking a learning target to motivationally relevant information will affect the salience of that target in proportion to the strength of the motivation.
By measuring how learning rates are potentiated by this motivational framing, it may be possible to measure a behavioral indicator of psychologically basic status and mate-seeking motives.
Moreover, this would demonstrate that status and mate-seeking motives directly affect reinforcement learning, and so, perhaps, shape exploratory behavior, learning, and decision-making during adolescence.

In designing an appropriate reinforcement learning task, it is important to consider that the optimal parameters governing the accumulation of information will differ depending on the stability of the association between the response to a stimulus and reward receipt (assuming the association is probabilistic).
For example, in the context of a task with a stable association, after some number of successful pairings, the learner should no longer be tempted to switch her response, thus ensuring she is not fooled by a random run of no-reward feedback.
However, if the association is not stable, and does actually switch (as is the case in reversal learning paradigms), the optimal learner should have a lower threshold for switching her association between a particular response and expected reward.
For the learning strategy captured by the the proposed task to have relevance for our understanding of real-world behavior, its association stabilities should roughly correspond to the stability of status-relevant and mate-seeking-relevant associations in the environment.

Both sociometric status and romantic relationships are fairly rank-order stable throughout adolescence.
In a study of roughly 300 adolescents with high sociometric status, estimates of the year-to-year stability from 6th-12th grade ranged between .51 and .72, with stability across all except a single 1-year interval above .6 [@cillessen2006].
The percent of adolescents reporting romantic relationships lasting 11 months or longer, an indicator of stability relevant for this task, increases from 20% at an age of 14 years, to roughly 60% at 16 years [@collins2003].
Given the brief temporal scale of the proposed task, it is reasonable to assume that participants would not prioritize learning strategies that are especially sensitive to changing associations.

# Aims

Motivations have been under-studied in efforts to understand changes in decision-making during adolescence, many of which have consequences for health and well-being.
Relevant motivations that are often only peripherally identified in the literature are well captured by the evolutionary-psychological approach codified in the FSM framework.
Mate-seeking and status motives are especially relevant for the adolescent development period.
Because learning and exploration are thought to be a crucial aspect of the importance of behavioral changes in adolescents, examining these motives using reinforcement learning provides the opportunity to better understand the motives, themselves, through a behavioral method, and also to understand the impact of motives on a mechanism related to learning and exploration.
Broadly speaking, the goal of this work is to investigate the appropriateness of this reinforcement learning task, as well as the ways in which these motives (measured in multiple ways) relate to attitudes and behaviors.

*Aim 1a: Does framing reinforcement learning targets with (mate-seeking and status) motive-related words increase stimulis salience and potentiate learning?* Relevance of the stimuli to individuals' underlying motives should affect the salience of stimuli, and thus also the rate at which individuals learn.
On average, it is expected that information related to status and mate-seeking motives will be motivationally relevant, and will potentiate learning over and above information in a baseline condition.

*Aim 1b: How does motive potentiation of learning covary with development?* It is likely that both status and mate-seeking motives increase between childhood and adolescence.
If differences in learning rates between stimuli with social and minimally-social relevance reflect underlying motives, then it is expected that learning potentiation due to motive-framing will increase from early to late adolescence.

*Aim 2: Does the motive potentiation of learning relate to a constellation of self-report measures that theoretically ought to demonstrate convergence? Specifically, (i) what is the relation between motive potentiation and self-report social motives; (ii) what is the relation between self-report social motives and motive-congruent health-related outcomes; and (iii) what is the relation between motive potentiation and motive-congruent health-related outcomes.*  It is expected that there will be a positive correlation between self-report measures of motives and outcomes, and differences in learning between social-motive conditions versus the baseline condition.
